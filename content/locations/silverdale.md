# Silverdale

**Silverdale** is a small farming village nestled in the Eastern Valley. It is best known as the birthplace of [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]].

## Geography

The village sits in a fertile valley fed by the Silver River, from which it takes its name. Rolling hills covered in farmland surround the settlement, and the Eastern Mountains are visible in the distance.

## History

### Founding

Silverdale was founded over 400 years ago by settlers seeking peaceful farmland. The rich soil and reliable water source made it an ideal location for agriculture.

### The Attack

In the Year 908 of the Third Era, Silverdale was attacked by shadow creatures—one of the first incursions of what would become the [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]]. It was during this attack that [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] first manifested her powers.

## Present Day

After the Shadow War, Silverdale has become something of a pilgrimage site. Visitors come to see the birthplace of the hero who saved the five kingdoms. A small shrine marks the spot where Aurora first used her powers.
