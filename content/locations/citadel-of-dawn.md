# Citadel of Dawn

The **Citadel of Dawn** is an ancient fortress located high in the Eastern Mountains. It serves as the headquarters of the [[lore/order-of-light|Order of Light]] and is considered one of the most sacred sites in the five kingdoms.

## History

### Foundation

The Citadel was constructed in the Year 112 of the First Era by the original members of the Order of Light. They chose this location because of its proximity to the first sunrise—the peaks catch the sun's rays before any other point in the known world.

### Architecture

The fortress is built from white marble quarried from the mountains themselves. Its towers are designed to capture and amplify natural light, creating an ever-present glow that can be seen for miles.

## Notable Features

### The Dawn Chamber

At the heart of the Citadel lies the Dawn Chamber, where the [[lore/dawn-crystal|Dawn Crystal]] was kept before the Shadow War. The chamber is designed so that on the summer solstice, sunlight fills the entire room with golden radiance.

### Training Grounds

The Citadel houses extensive training facilities where initiates of the Order learn to harness light magic. [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] spent three years training here.

### The Archives

The lower levels contain vast archives of ancient texts and scrolls, documenting thousands of years of history and magical knowledge.

## The Final Battle

During the [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]], the Citadel was the site of the climactic battle between [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] and [[characters/shadow-lord|The Shadow Lord]].

## Present Day

Today, the Citadel remains an active center for the Order of Light, welcoming pilgrims and training new generations of light wielders.
