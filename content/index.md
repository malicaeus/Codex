# Welcome to the Wiki

This is a **modern, file-based wiki template** built with React and Markdown. All content is stored in simple `.md` files that you can edit with any text editor.

## Getting Started

To add new content:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `/content` folder
2. Add YAML frontmatter at the top
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The wiki will automatically update

## Features

- **File-based content** - No database required
- **YAML frontmatter** - Define metadata for each article
- **Auto-generated navigation** - Folder structure becomes your sidebar
- **Dark/Light mode** - Built-in theme switching
- **Client-side search** - Fast, instant search across all articles
- **Wiki links** - Use `[[Article Name]]` syntax for internal links

## Folder Structure

```
/content
  /characters
    hero.md
    villain.md
  /locations
    ancient-city.md
  /lore
    history.md
    magic-system.md
  getting-started.md
```

Each folder becomes a category, and each `.md` file becomes an article.
