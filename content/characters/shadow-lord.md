# The Shadow Lord

**The Shadow Lord** was an ancient entity of pure darkness who attempted to conquer the five kingdoms during the [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]]. His origins remain shrouded in mystery.

## Origins

Little is known about the Shadow Lord's true origins. Ancient texts from the [[lore/order-of-light|Order of Light]] suggest he was once a mortal mage who delved too deeply into forbidden magic.

### The Corruption

According to legend, the mage discovered a tear in reality—a wound in the fabric of existence that leaked pure shadow energy. Instead of sealing it, he attempted to harness its power, becoming consumed by darkness.

## Rise to Power

For centuries, the Shadow Lord gathered his strength in the [[locations/void-realm|Void Realm]], building an army of shadow creatures and corrupted beings.

### The Invasion

In the Year 910 of the Third Era, the Shadow Lord launched his invasion of the mortal realm. His forces emerged from shadow portals across all five kingdoms simultaneously.

## Defeat

The Shadow Lord was ultimately defeated by [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] wielding the [[lore/dawn-crystal|Dawn Crystal]]. The final battle took place at the [[locations/citadel-of-dawn|Citadel of Dawn]].

## Legacy

Though defeated, the Shadow Lord's influence lingers. Some fear he may one day return, as no mortal weapon can truly destroy an entity of pure shadow.
