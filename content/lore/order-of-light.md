# Order of Light

The **Order of Light** is an ancient organization of mages and warriors dedicated to harnessing light magic and protecting the world from darkness.

## History

### Origins

The Order was founded in the Year 100 of the First Era, shortly after the first recorded incursion of shadow creatures. A group of mages discovered they could repel these creatures using concentrated light energy.

### The First Era

During the First Era, the Order established the [[locations/citadel-of-dawn|Citadel of Dawn]] as their headquarters and began systematically documenting light magic techniques.

### Modern Era

By the Third Era, the Order had become somewhat diminished, with many dismissing shadow creatures as mere legend. The [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]] forced them back into prominence.

## Structure

### Hierarchy

The Order is led by a Grand Master, supported by a council of seven High Luminaries. Below them are Masters, full members, and initiates.

### Training

New members undergo years of rigorous training at the [[locations/citadel-of-dawn|Citadel of Dawn]], learning to harness and control light energy.

## The Dawn Crystal

The Order is the guardian of the [[lore/dawn-crystal|Dawn Crystal]], the most powerful artifact of light magic in existence.

## Notable Members

- [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] - The prophesied hero
- Master Orin - Aurora's mentor
- Grand Master Seraphina - Current leader
