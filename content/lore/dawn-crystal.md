# Dawn Crystal

The **Dawn Crystal** is the most powerful artifact of light magic known to exist. It played a crucial role in ending the [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]].

The Crystal appears as a perfectly clear gem about the size of a human fist. It emits a soft, warm glow that intensifies in the presence of darkness. When wielded by someone with light affinity, it can channel enormous amounts of pure light energy.

## History

### Discovery

The Crystal was discovered by the founders of the [[lore/order-of-light|Order of Light]] in the early First Era. It was used to establish the [[locations/citadel-of-dawn|Citadel of Dawn]].

### The Shadow War

During the [[lore/shadow-war|Shadow War]], [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] was the first person in centuries able to fully wield the Crystal's power. She used it to defeat the [[characters/shadow-lord|Shadow Lord]].
