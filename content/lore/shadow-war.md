# The Shadow War

The **Shadow War** was a devastating conflict that lasted from Year 908 to 912 of the Third Era. It pitted the forces of the [[characters/shadow-lord|Shadow Lord]] against the combined might of the five kingdoms and the [[lore/order-of-light|Order of Light]].

## Prelude

### Warning Signs

For years before the war, there had been increasing reports of shadow creature sightings and unexplained darkness in remote areas. Most dismissed these as superstition.

### The Attack on Silverdale

The war effectively began with the attack on [[locations/silverdale|Silverdale]] in Year 908. This event marked the first major incursion and also revealed [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora Lightbringer]] to the world.

## The Conflict

### Early Years (908-910)

The initial years of the war went poorly for the kingdoms. Shadow portals opened across the land, and conventional weapons proved largely ineffective against shadow creatures.

### The Alliance

In Year 910, the five kingdoms finally set aside their differences and formed an alliance under the banner of the [[lore/order-of-light|Order of Light]]. [[characters/aurora-lightbringer|Aurora]], now trained, was named champion of the alliance.

### The Dawn Campaign (911-912)

Aurora led a campaign to close the major shadow portals, culminating in a direct assault on the [[characters/shadow-lord|Shadow Lord's]] stronghold.

## The Final Battle

The war concluded at the [[locations/citadel-of-dawn|Citadel of Dawn]], where Aurora used the [[lore/dawn-crystal|Dawn Crystal]] to defeat the Shadow Lord and seal the rift to the Void Realm.

## Aftermath

### Casualties

The war claimed hundreds of thousands of lives across all five kingdoms. Some regions remain scarred by shadow corruption to this day.

### Legacy

The Shadow War united the five kingdoms as never before. The alliance formed during the war evolved into the Council of Five, which maintains peace to this day.
